Modified version of 6502-emu by DavidBuchanan314. 

Modified to support SOME 65C02 opcodes (the ones I care about). The serial IO has been modified to match the operation of the Arudino Nano on the real hardware.

Includes options to force uppercase character input (again, to match the real hardware)
